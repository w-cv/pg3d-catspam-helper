To use this helper, first install the python libraries (this script is for Windows PC user)

## Setup
1. after downloading the script, scroll to line 88, you need to go to pg3d wiki, and fill in the delays for your loadout, for example, the delay in the current script is for loadout: Ultimatum, sharp puck, touchdown gautlet, terramorphing stone, any double delay sniper, howl of the mummy.
2. Then you want to modify the weapon_order at line 93, this is the order the script will cycle the weapons
3. you should set the hotkeys for weapon to 1,2,3,4,5,6 as default, you can modify the script yourself if you uses different hotkeys
4. you should use have at least 1 no delay weapon (no all 3 delays) in your loadout, if melee switching is required. if melee has fixed delay, the script will automatically change to switching to the one without delay. (e.g. special switching instead of melee-switching)
5. after the script started running, press ` key on keyboard, and it prints True, indicating the helper starts, and whenever you make a click, the script will automatically switch to the next weapon, so you can simply perform cat spam by spam clicking
6. press ` whenever you are not in game, as it may send clicks and causes you to misclick things
7. press q in game to perform auto touchdown gautlet charged attack, you can hold q if you want consequtive charge attacks, also it switches back to the original weapon before you press q automatically, so you can again spam click to cat spam
8. also there is a secret part that activates when you press backspace, it activates a secrete functionality, that helps you play at a even higher level, but you need to use the exact loadout i mentioned above, or part of it won't work, you can review the code and modify it if you feel like using it.
